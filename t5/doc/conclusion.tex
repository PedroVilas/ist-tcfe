\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the primary objective  was achieved.\par
As normally we do we analysed in theory the circuit presented using the Octave maths tool, and by circuit simulation, using the
Ngspice tool. The theoretical results obtained differed quite a lot from those obtained in the simulation analysis. This difference obtained is due to the fact that the models used for the OP-AMP in the theoretical analysis are very different from those used by Ngspice. The OP-AMP model that was used in Ngspice is way more complex than the one implemented theoretically. But with the differente aproaches that we take during the laboratory we tried to reduce the discrepancy of the results.
